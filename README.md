### LAST ONE STANDING

Last One Standing is a pretty simple game mode in which all players battle to the death to be the last one standing. When a player dies, they will not respawn and will instead become a spectator until the match ends.

This mode features a "Death Tax," which is somewhat similar to the arena mode in Fortnite. You can set an amount of bits to be charged upon a player's death (referred to as the Death Tax). These bits will accumulate in the final prize pool, which is awarded to the last one standing.
- For example: If the Death Tax is set at 20, you will lose 20 bits upon dying. However, if you win, you will receive the Death Tax multiplied by the number of players.


**The Death Tax** is entirely optional; if you choose not to have it and set the 'Death Tax' to 0, you will not receive any tokens from playing the game mode.
