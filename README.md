### LAST ONE STANDING

Last one standing is a pretty simple gamemode were all players fight to the death to be the *last one standing*, on a player's death they will not respawn and will instead become a spectator until the match ends.

This mod has a "Death tax", not too disimilar to the arena mode in fortnite, you can set an amount of bits that will be charged on a player's death (called the Death tax), these bits will accumulate to the final prize pool, which goes to the last one standing.
- For example: If the death tax is 20, if you die you will loose 20 bits. If you win however, you will recieve the death tax times the amount of players.


**Death tax is entirely optional**, if you choose to not have it, and set 'Death tax' to 0, you will not recieve any tokens from playing the gamemode.
